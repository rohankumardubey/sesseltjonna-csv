# sesseltjonna-csv: High-performance CSV databinding
![alt text][hytta.jpg]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skjolber/sesseltjonna-csv.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/skjolber/sesseltjonna-csv)

**sesseltjonna-csv** is a high-performance CSV databinding library with developer-friendly configuration options.

Projects using this library will benefit from:

 * dynamically generated CSV parsers per file (at runtime, using [ASM])
 * per-field configuration options
 * builder with support for syntactic sugar and customization options
 * world-class performance according to the [benchmarks]. 

In a nutshell, a very specific parser is generated per unique CSV file header, which yields extremely fast processing while allowing for per-field customizations. 

The primary use-case for this library is __large csv files__ with more than 1000 lines where the CSV file format is known and reasonable stable.

Bugs, feature suggestions and help requests can be filed with the [issue-tracker].

## Obtain
The project is implemented in Java and built using [Maven]. The project is available on the central Maven repository.

Example dependency config:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.skjolber.sesseltjonna-csv</groupId>
    <artifactId>sesseltjonna-csv</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.4</version>
</dependency>
```

# Usage
Use the builder to configure your parser.

```java
CsvMapper<Trip> mapper = CsvMapper.builder(Trip.class)
        .stringField("route_id")
            .setter(Trip::setRouteId)
            .quoted()
            .optional()
        .stringField("service_id")
            .setter(Trip::setServiceId)
            .required()
        .build();
```

where each field must be either `required` or `optional`. Use of the `setter` is optional; a setter with the same name as the field name will be automatically selected in its abscense. 

Then create a `CsvReader` using


```java
Reader reader = ...; // your input

CsvReader<Trip> csvReader = mapper.create(reader);
```

and parse untill `null` using

```java
do {
    Trip trip = csvReader.next();
    if(trip == null) {
        break;
    }

   // your code here    
} while(true);
```

If you're into doing some custom logic before applying values, add your own `consumer`:

```java
CsvMapper<City> mapping = CsvMapper.builder(City.class)
    .longField("Population")
        .consumer((city, n) -> city.setPopulation(n * 1000))
        .optional()
	.build();
```

## Intermediate processor
The library supports an `intermediate processor` for handling complex references. In other words when a column value maps to a child or parent object, it can be resolved at parse or post-processing time. For example by resolving a `Country` when parsing a `City` using an instance of `MyCountryLookup` - first the mapper:

```java
CsvMapper<City> mapping = CsvMapper.builder(City.class, MyCountryLookup.class)
    .longField("Country")
        .consumer((city, lookup, country) -> city.setCountry(lookup.getCountry(country))
        .optional()
	.build();
```

Then supply an instance of of the `intermediate processor` when creating the `CsvRader`:

```java
MyCountryLookup lookup = ...;

CsvReader<City> csvReader = mapper.create(reader, lookup);
```

Using this feature can be essential when parsing multiple CSV files in parallel, or even fragments of the same file in parallel, with entities referencing each other, storing the values in intermediate processors and resolving references as a post-processing step. 

# Performance
The generated instances are extremely fast (i.e. as good as a parser tailored very specifically to the file being parsed), but note that the assumption is that the number of different CSV files for a given application or format is limited, so that parsing effectively is performed by a JIT-compiled class and not by a newly generated class for each file.

To maximize performance (like response time) it is always necessary to pre-warm the JVM regardless of the underlying implementation.

JMH [benchmark results](https://github.com/skjolber/csv-benchmark#results). 

# Compatibility
The following rules / restrictions apply, mostly for keeping in sync with RFC-4180

 * Quoted fields must be declared as quoted (in the builder) and can contain all characters. 
 * The first character of a quoted field must be a quote. If not, the value is treated as a plain field. 
 * Plain fields must not contain the separator or newline, otherwise can contain all characters.
 * All fields are either required or optional (no empty string is ever propagated to the target). Missing values result in CsvException.
 * All lines must contain the same number of columns
 * Corrupt files can result in CsvException
 * Newline and carriage return + newline line endings are supported (and auto-detected).
 * Columns which have no mapping are skipped (ignored).

Also note that

 * The default mode assumes the first line is the header. For fixed formats, a default parser can be created.
 * Maximum line length is per default 64K. 64K should be enough to hold a lot of lines, if not try increasing the buffer size to improve performance.
